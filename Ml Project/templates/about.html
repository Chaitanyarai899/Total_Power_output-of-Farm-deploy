        <h1>About Dataset</h1>
        <p class="data_info">This data set consists of positions and absorbed power outputs
        of wave energy converters (WECs) in four real wave scenarios from 
        the southern coast of Australia (Sydney, Adelaide, Perth and 
        Tasmania). The applied converter model is a fully submerged 
        three-tether converter called CETO [1]. 16 WECs locations are 
        placed and optimized in a size-constrained environment. In terms 
        of optimization, the problem is categorised as an expensive 
        optimization problem that each farm evaluation takes several 
        minutes. The results are derived from several popular and 
        successful Evolutionary optimization methods that are published 
        in [2,3].</p>

            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p class="introduction">The amount of power generated by a wave farm depends on 
            the Wave Energy Converter (WEC) arrangement along with the 
            usual wave conditions. Therefore, forming the appropriate 
            arrangement of WECs in an array is an important factor in 
            maximizing power absorption. Data collected from the test 
            sites is used to design a model for predicting wave 
            farm's power output generated. This model focuses on 
            developing a neural model for the prediction of wave energy 
            based on the data set derived from the four real wave 
            scenarios from the southern coast of Australia. The applied 
            converter model is a fully submerged three-tether converter 
            called CETO. A precise analysis of the WEC placement is 
            investigated to reveal the amount of power generated by the
            wave farms on the test site
